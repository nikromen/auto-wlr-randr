# # Output patterns are matched against multiple identifiers:
# #   - Output name: "eDP-1", "HDMI-A-1", "DP-1"
# #   - Identifier (make, model, optionally serial): "Dell Inc. DELL U2718Q" or "Dell Inc. DELL U2718Q ABC123456"
#
# # Glob patterns work on all match targets:
# #   - "HDMI-*" - match any HDMI output
# #   - "Dell*" - match any Dell monitor
# #   - "*ABC*" - match any output with "ABC"
# #   - "Dell Inc. * ABC123456" - match Dell with specific serial
# #   - "ABC123456" match monitor with "ABC123456" serial
# #
# # To find identifiers for your monitors, run:
# #   wlr-randr --json | jq '.[] | {name, make, model, serial}'
# #
# # This is example of make + model identifier:
# output = "Dell Inc. DELL XYZ ABC"
# on = true
# mode = "1920x1080@144Hz"

# # This is settings for second monitor/output
# [[profile.my_profile.settings]]

#
# # This is another profile

#
# # We could only run a command without using wlr-randr if you want, just skip the settings
# # and only put output there that should match. If you want to execute commands in sequence,

# [[profile.another_profile.settings]]

# [[profile.yet_another_profile.settings]]
# # Could be either output name or identifier. Glob patterns are supported.
# # This is example of make + model identifier and serial:
# output = "Dell Inc. DELL XYZ ABC"

# mode = "1920x1080@144Hz"
